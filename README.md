# Programming-Skills-Level0

This repository contains exercises from a Discord community where the goal is to gain experience in development for people who don't have it.

Those are my resolutions.


"This repository contains a series of entry-level exercises that can be solved in any programming language. The purpose of these exercises is to develop your programming logic. This repository is the first in a series of more exercises to improve your programming skills."
