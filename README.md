# Programming-Skills-Level0

This repository contains a series of entry-level exercises that can be solved in any programming language. The purpose of these exercises is to develop your programming logic. This repository is the first in a series of more exercises to improve your programming skills.

> I'm learning Rust by completing these exercises.
> All suggestions to improve my Rust-like code and programming logic are welcome.
> I come from Frontend Development, feel free to joke me if you see how I turn Rust into spaghetti JS :)
