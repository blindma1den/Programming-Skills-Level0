'''
*       Create a currency converter between CLP, ARS, USD, EUR, TRY, GBP with the following features:
* 		The user must choose their initial currency and the currency they want to exchange to.
* 		The user can choose whether or not to withdraw their funds. If they choose not to withdraw, it should return to the main menu.
* 		If the user decides to withdraw the funds, the system will charge a 1% commission.
* 		Set a minimum and maximum amount for each currency, it can be of your choice.
* 		The system should ask the user if they want to perform another operation. If they choose to do so, it should restart the process; 
*       otherwise, the system should close.
